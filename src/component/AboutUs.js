												<h1>Our Mission</h1>
												<p>
													Welcome! Our team believes that the visualization of
													climate change is a pivotal tool in spreading
													awareness and the need to act.
												</p>
												<p>
													VisualClimate demonstrates changes on a map for
													temperature, CO2, and drought levels throughout a
													centuryâ€™s worth of US climate change data. Along with
													chart visualization, this application also allows the
													user to seek nearby jobs opportunities that are
													related to climate change.

											<h2>Fullstack technologies that were used</h2>
											<ul>
												<li>
													The backbone of this application uses React Mapbox GL
													and React to track temperature changes over time in
													color.
												</li>
												<li>
													D3 supports the map with traditional chart
													visualization. Our climate data is pulled from the
													National Centers for Environmental Protection and
													National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
												</li>
												<li>
													We use Firebase to store our job data, which is
													received from the Indeed Jobs API.
												</li>
												<li>
													Create React App serves as the scaffold for our entire
													application and Material UI is used for styling.
												</li>
