# VisualClimate

Welcome! Our team believes that the visualization of climate change is a pivotal tool in spreading awareness and the need to act.

VisualClimate demonstrates changes on a map for temperature, CO2, and drought levels throughout a centuryâ€™s worth of US climate change data. Along with chart visualization, this application also allows the user to seek nearby jobs opportunities that are related to climate change.

## Technologies

* The backbone of this application uses React Mapbox GL and React to track temperature changes over time in color.
* D3 supports the map with traditional chart visualization. Our climate data is pulled from the National Centers for Environmental Protection and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
* We use Firebase to store our job data, which is received from the Indeed Jobs API. 
* [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) serves as the scaffold for our entire application and Material UI is used for styling.

### Available Scripts

You must install the required dependencies for the application to run correctly:

### `npm install`

In order for Firebase to load correctly, please create a .env.local file in the root folder. We included a template called .env.example in the root folder. You will need to rename it to .env.local, fill it with your firebase credentials, and then add .env.local to your .gitignore file.

**Notes:**
* For the .env.local file to work with the create-react-app, notice that your variables require a REACT_APP prefix.

* Remember to include your .env.local file in the .gitignore file

* Firebase is loading geoJson data that renders state shapes and is a pivotal piece the application. You can find our template here: [geoJson](https://storage.cloud.google.com/visualclimategeojson/us-temp.geojson)

Once your setup is complete, you can run the following script in the project directory:

### `npm start`

This script runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Deployment

We have a deploy bash script for Heroku located in our script folder. It is designed to take your deployment branch and launch that into Heroku's master branch.

You will need to configure a new application with Heroku first if you would like to launch a clone of this repository.

## VisualClimate's Future

We believe in this application and aim to continue iterating towards its full potential. Here are some ideas we'd like to create:

* Machine Learning future temperature projections
* Volunteer Opportunities
* Donation Feature for Climate Change Initiatives
* Blog
